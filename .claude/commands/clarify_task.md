**Task Description**
Read the following task description carefully.
Your goal is to achieve complete clarity about the scope and purpose of the task.

If anything in the task description is unclear, ambiguous, imprecise, or insufficiently described, you must ask clarifying questions until you fully understand the task.
Continue asking new questions if the answers lead to further need for clarification.

This phase is completed when you no longer have any further questions.

**Understand the context: Pre-research clarification**
This process is a preparatory clarification phase:

* The purpose is to ensure clarity and precision in the formulation and scope of the task.
* When this phase is complete, a codebase research phase follows, where you examine the concrete implementation in Dinero’s codebase.
* This research will likely lead to additional questions, which will be handled in a post-research clarification phase.
